/**
 * PaymentStateMachine
 *
 * Enforces valid state transitions at the service layer.
 * Any attempt to move to an invalid state throws — the DB never sees
 * an inconsistent status.
 *
 * Valid transitions:
 *
 *   PENDING   → CONFIRMING  (tx detected by listener)
 *   PENDING   → EXPIRED     (expiry job — no tx arrived)
 *   PENDING   → FAILED      (explicit failure, e.g., wallet suspended)
 *   CONFIRMING → COMPLETED  (N confirmations reached)
 *   CONFIRMING → FAILED     (tx reverted or dropped)
 *   COMPLETED  → REFUNDED   (manual or automated refund initiated)
 *
 * Terminal states: COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED, EXPIRED
